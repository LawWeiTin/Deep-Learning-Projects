  <li><strong>Deep Learning CA1</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Part A:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</li>
          <li>I was given a task to classify vegetable images using CNNs. I used techniques such as data cleaning, data augmentation, model selection, model improvement by hypertuning, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Part B:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</li>
          <li>I was given a task to predict movie review sentiment using RNNS. I used NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, embeddings, etc.</li>
        </ul>

  <li><strong>CA2</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Part A:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</li>
          <li>I was given a task to generate images from the EMNIST letters dataset. I used techniques such as data cleaning, computing FID/KID, model selection, model improvement by hypertuning, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Part B:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
          <li>Used DQN to solve Pendulum-v0 task.</li>
